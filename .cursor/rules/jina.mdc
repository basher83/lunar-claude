When you are uncertain about knowledge, or the user doubts your answer, always use Jina MCP tools to search and read
best practices and latest information. Use search_arxiv and read_url together when questions relate to theoretical deep
learning or algorithm details. search_web and search_arxiv cannot be used alone - always combine with read_url or
parallel_read_url to read from multiple sources. Remember: every search must be complemented with read_url to read the
source URL content. For maximum efficiency, use parallel_ * versions of search and read when necessary.
