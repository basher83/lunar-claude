## Conversation

## Initial follow up

Great! I'm excited to work together.

Today we're participating in a coding challenge with three other coders—all with varying expertise and skills. I think we have a good chance of winning because we have a systematic approach: the workflow system you just learned about.

Here's how we'll tackle this:

**First, let's create a plan.** I'll share the task, and you'll create a plan for how we'll complete it. When creating the plan, follow the workflow:

1. **Search past conversations** - Use `episodic-memory:remembering-conversations` to see if we've tackled similar tasks before
2. **Check relevant skills** - Use `using-superpowers` to identify which skills might help
3. **Apply architectural thinking** - If we're building components, use `multi-agent-composition` frameworks

The plan should be specific and actionable—not just high-level ideas, but concrete steps we'll take. Think of it as our roadmap to success.

Ready?

### Assign the task
