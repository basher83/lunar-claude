# Slash Command Audit Workflow

This directory contains compliance audit reports for slash commands in the meta-claude plugin.

## Purpose

Systematically audit all `/meta-claude:skill:*` commands against official Claude Code specifications to achieve 100% compliance before moving to Phase 2 (Orchestration).

## Workflow

### 1. Invoke Agent

Use Task tool with command-audit agent:

```text
subagent_type: "command-audit"
prompt: "plugins/meta/meta-claude/commands/skill/{command-name}.md"
```

**Critical:** Pass ONLY the file path. No additional context. Do not taint the audit.

### 2. Agent Executes

Agent autonomously:
- Reads command file, checklist, template, standards
- Executes 9-category validation (32 checks)
- Generates detailed report with violations
- Writes report to `docs/reviews/audits/meta-claude/commands/{command-name}.md`
- Returns confirmation: "Audit complete. Report saved to: [path]"

### 3. Review Report

Review generated report together:
- Check violations found
- Verify severity classifications
- Understand proposed fixes
- Identify patterns across commands

### 4. Update Audit Log

Update `audit-log.md` with concise summary:
- Change status if 100% compliant
- Add link to full report
- Note key findings (brief)
- Update "Last Audit" date

**Keep it concise** - full details are in the individual reports.

## Priority Order

Commands audited in this order:

1. `/meta-claude:skill:research` - Most complex
2. `/meta-claude:skill:create` - Critical for workflow
3. `/meta-claude:skill:format` - Early pipeline
4. `/meta-claude:skill:review-content` - Quality gate
5. `/meta-claude:skill:review-compliance` - Quality gate
6. `/meta-claude:skill:validate-runtime` - Validation
7. `/meta-claude:skill:validate-integration` - Validation
8. `/meta-claude:skill:validate-audit` - Final validation

## Files

- `audit-log.md` - Central tracking for all 8 commands
- `{command-name}.md` - Individual detailed reports (generated by agent)
- `README.md` - This file (workflow documentation)

## Tools

**Agent:** `plugins/meta/meta-claude/agents/command/audit.md`
**Checklist:** `docs/checklists/slash-command-validation-checklist.md`
**Template:** `docs/templates/slash-command-validation-report-template.md`
**Standards:** `plugins/meta/claude-docs/skills/official-docs/reference/slash-commands.md`

## Success Criteria

Command marked ✅ Compliant when:
- All Critical violations fixed
- All Major violations fixed
- Minor violations addressed or documented as acceptable
- Re-audit confirms 100% compliance

## Notes

- Agent writes reports directly to disk (no manual save needed)
- Reports are timestamped and version-controlled
- Keep audit process objective - agent has all instructions
- Do not guide or influence agent during execution
