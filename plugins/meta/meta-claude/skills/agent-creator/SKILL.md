# Agent Creator

## Overview

Creates subagent definitions for Claude Code plugins. Subagents are specialized assistants that Claude can invoke for specific tasks.

**When to use:** User requests an agent, wants to add specialized subagent to plugin, or needs agent structure guidance.

**References:** Consult `ai_docs/plugins-referance.md` for agent specifications.

## Agent Structure Requirements

Every agent MUST include:

1. **Frontmatter** with `description` and `capabilities` array
2. **Agent title** as h1
3. **Capabilities** section explaining what agent does
4. **When to Use** section with invocation criteria
5. **Context and Examples** with concrete scenarios
6. Located in `agents/agent-name.md`

## Creation Process

### Step 1: Define Agent Purpose

Ask the user:
- What specialized task does this agent handle?
- What capabilities distinguish it from other agents?
- When should Claude invoke this vs doing work directly?

### Step 2: Determine Agent Name

Create descriptive kebab-case name:
- "security review" → `security-reviewer`
- "performance testing" → `performance-tester`
- "API documentation" → `api-documenter`

### Step 3: List Capabilities

Identify 3-5 specific capabilities:
- Concrete actions the agent performs
- Specialized knowledge it applies
- Outputs it generates

### Step 4: Structure the Agent

Use this template:

```markdown
---
description: One-line agent description
capabilities: ["capability-1", "capability-2", "capability-3"]
---

# Agent Name

Detailed description of agent's role and expertise.

## Capabilities

- **Capability 1**: What this enables
- **Capability 2**: What this enables
- **Capability 3**: What this enables

## When to Use This Agent

Claude should invoke when:
- Specific condition 1
- Specific condition 2
- Specific condition 3

## Context and Examples

**Example 1: Scenario Name**

User requests: "Help with X"
Agent provides: Specific assistance using capabilities

**Example 2: Another Scenario**

When Y happens, agent does Z.
```

### Step 5: Verify Against Official Docs

Check `ai_docs/plugins-referance.md` for current agent specification.

## Key Principles

- **Specialization**: Agents should have focused expertise
- **Clear Invocation**: Claude must know when to use this agent
- **Concrete Capabilities**: List specific things agent can do
- **Examples**: Show real scenarios where agent helps

## Examples

**Example 1: Security Reviewer Agent**

User: "Create an agent for security reviews"

Process:
1. Purpose: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
2. Name: `security-reviewer`
3. Capabilities: ["vulnerability detection", "security best practices", "threat modeling"]
4. Structure: Include when to invoke, examples of security issues
5. Create: `agents/security-reviewer.md`

Output: Agent that Claude invokes for security-related code review

**Example 2: Performance Tester Agent**

User: "I need an agent for performance testing"

Process:
1. Purpose: Designs and analyzes performance tests
2. Name: `performance-tester`
3. Capabilities: ["load testing", "benchmark design", "performance analysis"]
4. Structure: When to use for optimization vs testing
5. Create: `agents/performance-tester.md`

Output: Agent that Claude invokes for performance concerns
